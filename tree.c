     tree

        simple tree : the number of its child node is no limit.

        binary tree : the number of its child node is two at most.
                      when it has 2 child nodes in a node, they got order.

                      simple binary tree:
                      full binary tree: 2child node for every node.
                      complete binary tree: select the whole row when delete.

             forest : mutually disjoint tree set.


     binary tree's storage:
         continuous storage : array
         waste of memory.
         time complexity is 0.
